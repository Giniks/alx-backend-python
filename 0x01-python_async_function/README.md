## Description
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await` syntax, `asyncio` library, concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and utilizing the `random` module.

## Project Details
- **Start Date:** Feb 19, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** Feb 20, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** Feb 19, 2024 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and utilize `async` and `await` syntax in Python
- Execute asynchronous programs with `asyncio`
- Run concurrent coroutines
- Create and manage asyncio tasks
- Utilize the `random` module for generating random values

## Requirements
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- All files must be executable
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules should have documentation
- All functions should have documentation
- Tasks length will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
### The Basics of Async
Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument...

### Let's Execute Multiple Coroutines at the Same Time with Async
Import `wait_random` and write an async routine called `wait_n`...

### Measure the Runtime
From the previous file, import `wait_n` into `measure_runtime.py`...

### Tasks
Import `wait_random` from `0-basic_async_syntax`. Write a function...
